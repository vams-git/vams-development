## Adding inactive identifier in Maintenance Pattern
### Specification
Natively, there's no inactive field available on Maintenance Pattern (MP) record view. The active status of a MP is driven by the status of the associated MP equipment i.e. if the MP equipment status is active we can say that the MP is active as well.
